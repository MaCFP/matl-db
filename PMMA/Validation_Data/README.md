## Experimental Measurements for Pyrolysis Model Validation - Anaerobic Gasification of PMMA Under External Thermal Radiation


### Test Overview

A set of  16 anaerobic gasification experiments was conducted on the poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, that was made available to participants in the MaCFP-2 Workshop. In each test, samples (i.e., PMMA discs of approximate dimensions: 7 cm diameter, 5.8 mm thickness) were exposed to radiant heating (nominally 25 kW m-2 or 50 kW m-2 across their top surface) in an anaerobic environment. Samples were insulated at their back surface and continuously heated until complete decomposition was observed. Test boundary conditions (e.g., time- and spatially-resolved measurements of incident radiant heat flux; chamber wall temperatures) were carefully characterized, as described below.


Measurement data obtained in this test series includes:
1. Time-resolved measurements of PMMA sample mass [g];
2. Time-resolved measurements of PMMA back surface temperature [K];
3. Photographs and video of PMMMA decomposition behavior;
4. Time-resolved measurements of temperature rise [K] of inert materials (Copper, Kaowool PM insulation board);
