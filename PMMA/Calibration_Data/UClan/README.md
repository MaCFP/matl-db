### Experimental Conditions: TGA, DSC
[Number of tests // instrument used (manufacturer // STA or TGA and DSC separately) ?]
* Heating Rate: 10 K/min
* Temperature program
  - Initial Temperature: 300 K
  - Initial Isotherm: None
  - Maximum Temperature: 973 K
  - Final Isotherm: None
* Sample mass: 2-6 mg
* Sample geometry: powdered
* Calibration: Method of temperature calibration: Onset temperature, 5 calibration points; Temperature range of the calibration Indium - 100-200C, Zinc - 360-480C; Frequency of calibration: Known samples run every three months, full calibration only then performed if these are out of tolerance. Otherwise yearly or after maintenance and/or config change

### Experimental Conditions: Cone Calorimeter
Note: Cone HRR data was provided as HRR [kW] as originally requested. This dataset was then scaled to provide [kW/m2] assuming a sample surface area of 0.0088m2 (standard for cone calorimeter tests with a sample holder cover)
Additionally, back surface temperature measurements were originally output at 2Hz, they have been linearaly interpolated here to provide estimates of Temperature at 1Hz.
[Type of cone, open/closed, number of replicate tests?]
* Extraction flow rate: [?]
* Sample holder dimensions:
    - steel frame 10 x 10 cm
    - Retainer frame/grid: [None?]
* Backing Insulation: glass wool [thickness / density / thermal properties?]
* Thermocouple location:
    - [?]
