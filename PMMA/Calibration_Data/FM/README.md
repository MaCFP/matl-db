### Test Summary
Three repeated pyrolysis tests were conducted to measure the mass loss and front surface temperature of pyrolysis tests in nitrogen environment at external heat flux of 25 and 65 kW/m2, respectively. The sample has a circular shape, with a diameter of 9.52 cm (3.75 in.) and thickness of 0.6 cm. The sample was insulated both on the side and bottom.

#### Experimental Conditions
* Extraction/N2 flow rate: [??] L/s
* Sample Surface Area: 0.00712 m2 (nominal)
* Sample holder dimensions:
    - at least 9.5 cm... [??]
* Backing Insulation:  Four layers of 3 mm (1/8 in.) thick Cotronics ceramic paper thermal insulation are placed on the bottom and a spiral of the same material is wound around the sides. The thermal conductivity of the Contronics paper (0.028 W/mK).
* Thermocouple locations 
    - Sample front surface temperature was measured with [TC, radiometer, IR camera?] at [location; center?]
