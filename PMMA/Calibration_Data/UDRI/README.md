###### Tests Conducted in Nitrogen 

|Test Name | Initial Sample Mass (mg)|  
|----------|:------:|  
|UDRI\_TGA\_N2\_10K\_1 | 7.157|  
|UDRI\_TGA\_N2\_10K\_2 | 6.630|  
|UDRI\_TGA\_N2\_10K\_3 | 6.906|  



### Experimental Conditions, Cone calorimeter
* Extraction flow rate: 24L/s
* Sample Surface Area: 0.00884
* Sample holder dimensions:
    - Square pan: 106mm x 106mm x 25mm
    - Retainer frame: 111mm x 111mm x 54mm (opening dimensions: 94mm x 94mm)
    - Retaining grid: 2mm grid, 20mm spacing
* Backing Insulation: Ceramic wool thermal conductivity (measured via guarded hot plate:  0.04 W/m-K at  30 C) 
* Sample back side temperature was not measured. 
* Note - Aluminum foil damaged in many tests, so mass losses appear to be more than 100% as some of the aluminum foil was oxidized/lost during testing
