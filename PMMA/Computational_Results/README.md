## Predicted response of PMMA in idealized heating scenarios

This folder holds model predictions of sample decomposition in response to well-defined zero- and one-dimensional heating scenarios. 

Note: these idealized simulations should not be considered as verification or validation cases. Rather, they represent well-defined scenarios that can be used to assess the relative similarities or differences in predicted material response (when heated in fire-like conditions) when extrapolating to a space beyond model calibration conditions. Further analysis of these simulation results may provide insight into the underlying reasons for observed differences.
