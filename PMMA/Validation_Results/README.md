## Predicted response of PMMA in response to radiant heating in an anaerobic environment

This folder holds model predictions of sample decomposition in response to well-defined heating at incident heat fluxes of 25 kW m-2 and 50 kW m-2 in the NIST Gasification Apparatus.

Note: these simulations may be considered as validation cases as material properties were independently calibrated based on measurement data obtained in other heating/environmental conditions in different apparatus (see: Calibration_Data).
