### Experimental Conditions: TGA/DSC
A Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC3+ was used to simultaneously conduct Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiments. 

* Heating Rates: 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 K/min
* Temperature program
  - Initial Temperature: 304 K
  - Initial Isotherm: 1200 s (hold at 304 K for 1200 s)  
  - Maximum Temperature: 1074 K
  - Final Isotherm: 300 s (hold 1074 K for 300 s)
* Sample mass: 1 mg +/- 0.09 mg
* Sample geometry: Powdered
* Calibration type: Results are baselinde-corrected. Temperature and heat flow calibration were performed before the experimental campaign with aluminum, indium and zinc.
