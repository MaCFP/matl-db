# Experimental Conditions: TGA/DSC
A NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter was used to simultaneously conduct Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiments.
* Heating Rate: 10 K/min
* Temperature program
  - Initial Temperature: 303.15 K
  - Initial Isotherm: None
  - Maximum Temperature: 1072.65 K
  - Final Isotherm: None
* Sample mass: 4 mg +/- 0.3 mg
* Sample geometry: Powdered
* Calibration type: Before each experiment, a baseline test was performed using an empty crucible. Temperature/Heat flow calibration were performed every 2 months (or 100 tests, whichever is sooner) using a set of 8 reference materials with transition temperature between 298.15-1273.15 K
