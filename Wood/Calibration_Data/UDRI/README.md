### Experimental Conditions: MCC

A Deatak MCC-4 microscale combustion calorimeter was used to conduct MCC experiments in triplicate. Heat release was very reproducible for the wood powder sample tested. A polystyrene standard as an internal control was run as well. Key HRR data from these PS tests measured: (1) heat of combustion, 41.2 kJ/g to 41.8 kJ/g; (2) Peak HRR, 1099 W/g to  1166 W/g; (3) T\_Peak\_HRR 446 C to 448 C; (4) FGC 833 J/g-k to 859 J/g-k.

### Experimental Conditions, Cone calorimeter

Cone Calorimeter experiments were conducted on a Deatak CC-2 Cone Calorimeter (McHenry, IL USA) at 2 heat fluxes (30kW/m2 and 60kW/m2) with an exhaust flow of 24 L/s using the standardized cone calorimeter procedure (ASTM E1354-25). Samples were wrapped in aluminum foil on one side as per the ASTM E1354 standard and placed upon ceramic wool insulation for testing. No frame or grid were used. An external thermocouple was placed under the wood samples and recorded the rise in temperature during the burning.

Data collected from all samples is believed to have an error of ±10% and were calculated using a specimen surface area of 100 cm2. All samples were tested in duplicate as per  customer request.

* Test Standard: ASTM E1354-25
* Extraction flow rate: 24L/s
* Sample Surface Area: 0.01 m2 (nominal)
* Sample holder dimensions:

  * Square pan: 106mm x 106mm x 25mm
  * Retainer frame: None
  * Retaining grid: None

* Backing Insulation: (~2.54 cm thick) refractory fiber conforming to ASTM E1354.  
* Thermocouple location: under wood sample
* Ignition Source: (spark ignitor)
