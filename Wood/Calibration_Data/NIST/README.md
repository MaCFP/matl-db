### Molecular Composition / Formula
The elemental composition of virgin wood, gaseous pyrolyzates, and residual char (formed during anaerobic decomposition) is determined using a Thermo Fisher Flash 2000 organic elemental analyzer, which features two analytical channels for measuring either (1) carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur or (2) oxygen. Quantification of these species is achieved through gas chromatography thermal conductivity detection (GC-TCD). All tests are repeated in triplicate; average weight fractions (wt. %) and expanded uncertainties (95% confidence interval, _k_-factor = 2) are reported in the table below.

| Material | Carbon wt. % | Hydrogen wt. % | Nitrogen wt. % | Sulfur wt. % | Oxygen wt. % |
| --------- | :--------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
| 'MaCFP Wood'| 48.85 ± 1.96   | 6.13 ± 0.25    | 0.05 ± 0.01    | 0       | 40.69 ± 2.81   |
| Residual Char |91.17 ± 3.93   | 2.28 ± 0.09    | 0.13 ± 0.01    | 0       | 3.65 ± 2.74    |
| Gaseous Volatiles| 22.32 ± 4.03   | 8.55 ± 0.41    | 0.00 ± 0.02    | 0       | 63.91 ± 4.89   |

A heated, non-stirred pressure vessel to determine the average molecular weight of gaseous pyrolyzates. In the pressure vessel, approximately 1 g samples of a material of interest is heated above its decomposition temperature in an inert atmosphere (UHP helium, to prevent combustion). The average molecular weight of the evolved gaseous pyrolyzates was calculated by applying the ideal gas law at steady state based on knowledge of: (1) system volume (assumed constant during heating), (2) system temperature and pressure rise, and (3) the initial and final (solid residue) sample mass. 

Calibration tests were first run by filling the vessel with UHP helium, heating it to steady state (400◦C), and ensuring a proportional rise in measured system pressure and average temperature (spatially resolved measurements obtained), thus confirming the assumption of ideality. Validation testing was performed prior to the analysis of MaCFP-Wood. Specifically, water (H2O) and naphthalene (C10H8), which boil or sublimate to produce volatiles of known composition and molecular weight were tested. Measured average molecular weights of these two substances showed excellent agreement with expected values, matching within 2.6% and 1.0%, respectively.

Average Molecular Weight of Gaseous Volatiles: 34.7 g/mol +/- 3.7 g/mol
