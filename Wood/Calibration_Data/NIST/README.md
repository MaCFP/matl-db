# Template README File for NIST

### Molecular Composition / Formula
The elemental composition of virgin wood, gaseous pyrolyzates, and residual char (formed during anaerobic decomposition) is determined using a Thermo Fisher Flash 2000 organic elemental analyzer, which features two analytical channels for measuring either (1) carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur or (2) oxygen. Quantification of these species is achieved through gas chromatography thermal conductivity detection (GC-TCD). All tests are repeated in triplicate; average weight fractions (wt. %) and expanded uncertainties (95% confidence interval, _k_-factor = 2) are reported in the table below.

Further details regarding system calibration, validation, and quantification of measurement uncertainty is available in: [Tripi, A. , Greene, R. , Leventon, I. and McGrattan, K. (2025), Measurement of the Average Molecular Weights of Gaseous Pyrolyzates Produced by Combustible Solids, 16th International Conference and Exhibition on fire science and engineering, London, GB, [online], https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=960069 (Accessed December 4, 2025)]
