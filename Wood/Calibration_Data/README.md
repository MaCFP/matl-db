##MaCFP-4 Pyrolysis Model Calibration Data
This directory is designed to maintain experimental measurements conducted as part of the MaCFP-4 Pyrolysis Model Calibration Exercise. Measurement data provided here (from both mg- and g-scale tests) have been provided by fire safety science institutions around the world. If/when using this data, please cite the appropriate references, as provided in the corresponding README files.

### Key factors influencing material response during tests
Every effort was made to remove variability between results due to potential differences in material composition by sharing samples of the same exact wood, prepared for mg- and g-scale experiments: that is, all tests were performed on the exact same material, from the same source, and prepared in the same form (excluding minor variations, ~5%, in sample slab thickness, as produced by the manufacturer).

In many cases, data from the same test type under the same nominal test conditions  provided by different institutions may show qualitative agreement; in others, variations may be apparent. Some variations between datasets are simply stochastic (i.e., random, unavoidable noise in repeated tests). However, others may result from systematic causes such as calibration differences in mg-scale experiments or sample holder, insulation type, and/or heater temperature in g-scale experiments. When such measurement data is used as a reference for comparison with the results of numerical simulations, it is the responsibility of users of this data to be aware factors that can can affect this material flammability response. A short summary of these factors is provided below. 

#### Milligram-scale experiments
- Heating Rate
- Gaseous Environment
- Crucible Type
- Apparatus Calibration (should be performed for identical test conditions: heating rate, gaseous environment, crucible type)
- Baseline Correction (especially for DSC measurements)
- Initial Sample Mass (and geometry)

#### Gram-scale experiments
- Incident Heat Flux (and uniformity across sample's surface)
- Gaseous Environment (and flow rate, which can affect convective heat transfer at the sample's surface prior to gasification or burning)
- Backing Material (e.g., the presence or absence of an insulating substrate, and its thermal properties)
- Heater Temperature
- Exposed Sample Surface Area
- Sample Holder Characteristics (including the use/non-use of a retainer frame)
- Baseline Correction (especially for HRR measurements)
- Temperature Measurement Instrumentation and Location (e.g., IR camera vs. thermocouple; thermal contact)
