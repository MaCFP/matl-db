### Experimental Conditions: TGA/DSC
A NETZSCH STA 449 F5 Jupiter was used to simultaneously conduct Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiments. 
* Heating Rate: 10 K/min
* Temperature program
  - Initial Temperature: 3013 K 
  - Maximum Temperature: 973 K
  - Final Isotherm: 10 min (hold at 973 K for 300 s)
* Sample mass: 4-7 mg
* Sample geometry: Powdered
* Calibration type: For each actual test, a single baseline test was performed using an empty crucible.
