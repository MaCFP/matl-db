Dear all,

At Aalto, we were able to perform the TGA measurements using the STA device. In addition, DSC data are available; however, these were not measured using a separate dedicated DSC instrument.

Test Conditions:

Heating rate: 10 K·min⁻¹

Temperature program: Stabilization at 40 °C, followed by heating up to 800 °C

Initial sample moisture content: The stabilization step effectively acted as a drying stage; therefore, the exact initial moisture content is uncertain

Initial sample mass: Approximately 8 mg (due to instrument limitations, lower sample masses were not feasible)

Sample geometry: Sawdust chips

Carrier gas and flow rate: Nitrogen, 70 mL·min⁻¹

Crucible type and volume: Aluminum oxide (alumina), 85 µL

Crucible lid: None

Instrument and furnace: NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter coupled with QMS 403 Aeolos Quadro
