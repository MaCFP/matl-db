### Experimental Conditions: TGA/DSC

A Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 3+ was used to conduct Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) experiments.



* Heating Rate: 10 K/min
* Temperature program

  * Initial Temperature: 303 K
  * Isothermal Hold to Dry: 378 K for 180 s
  * Isothermal Hold: 303 K for 600 s
  * Maximum Temperature: 893 K
  * Final Isotherm: None

* Sample mass: 6 mg +/- 0.7 mg
* Sample geometry: Powdered
* Calibration type: Before each experiment, a baseline test was performed using an empty crucible. Temperature/Heat flow calibration are performed every 12 months (or 100 tests, whichever is sooner) using a set of 5 reference materials with melting temperatures between 60-820 C.
* Crucible

  * Type: AL
  * Volume: 40 uL
  * Inner Diameter: 5.52 mm
  * Outer Diameter: 7.81 mm
  * Mass: 49.2 mg
  * Lid: True
  * Note: Al- crucibles (tzero, outer diameter 7.81 mm / volume 40 uL) with a pierced lid (a small hole in the lid allowed for gaseous decomposition products to escape).

* Carrier Gas

  * Type: Nitrogen
  * Flow rate: 50 ml/min
  * Note: Ultra High Purity (UHP) Nitrogen

* Instrument

  * Type: Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 3+
  * Furnace Type: Ceramic
  * Notes: None

##### Test Summary

Cone Calorimeter experiments were conducted on an FTT iCone Mini (West Sussex, UK) at 1 heat flux (50 kW/m2) with an exhaust flow of 24 L/s using the standardized cone calorimeter procedure (ASTM E1354-25). Samples were wrapped in aluminum foil per the ASTM E1354 standard and placed upon ceramic wool insulation for testing. The optional retainer frame from ASTN 1354 was used. At 1410 seconds into FPL-Wood\_Cone\_50kW\_hor\_R2 connection to the DAQ was lost so flame out was recorded manually.
