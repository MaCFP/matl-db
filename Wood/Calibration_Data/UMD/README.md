### Experimental Conditions: TGA/DSC
A NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter was used to simultaneously conduct Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiments.

* Heating Rate: 10 K/min
* Temperature program
  - Initial Temperature: 294 K
  - Initial Isotherm: 1800 s (hold at 294 K for 1800 s)  
  - Maximum Temperature: 1098 K
  - Final Isotherm: 1800 s (hold at 1098 K for 1800 s)  
* Sample mass: 4 mg +/- 0.3 mg
* Sample geometry: Powdered
* Calibration type: Before each experiment, a baseline test was performed using an empty crucible. Temperature/Heat flow calibration were performed every 2 months (or 100 tests, whichever is sooner) using a set of 8 reference materials with transition temperature between 312-1081 K
* Crucible
  - Type: Pt-Rh
  - Volume: 85 uL
  - Diameter: 6.8 mm
  - Mass: 253.480 mg
  - Lid: True
  - Note: Pt-Rh crucibles (outer diameter 6.8mm / volume 85 uL) with a lid ( a small hole in the lid allowed for gaseous decomposition products to escape).
* Carrier Gas
  - Type: Nitrogen
  - Flow rate: 70 ml/min (50 mL/min purge, 20 mL/min protective)
  - Note: Ultra High Purity (UHP) Nitrogen
* Instrument
  - Type: NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter
  - Furnace Type: Platinum
  - Notes: None

| Test Name | O2 volume % |  Initial External Sample Mass (mg) | Sample Mass Prior to Heating Ramp
| --------- | :---------: | :------------------------: | :------------------------: |
|UMD\_STA\_N2\_10K\_R1 | 0 | 4.301| 4.066
|UMD\_STA\_N2\_10K\_R2 | 0 | 4.062| 3.842
|UMD\_STA\_N2\_10K\_R3 | 0 | 3.942| 3.904

**Notes:** **Initial External Sample Mass** refers to the mass of the sample before being inserted into the instrument. **Sample Mass Prior to Heating Ramp** refers to the mass of the sample at the beginning of the dynamic heating segment of the test. The discrepancy reflects moisture lost before the measurement begins and during the 1800 s isothermal segment prior to the heating ramp.
