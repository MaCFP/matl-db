### Experimental Conditions: TGA
A TG-DTA was used to simultaneously conduct Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) experiments. 

* Heating Rate: 10 K/min
* Temperature program
  - Initial Temperature: 300 K
  - Initial Isotherm: 1500 s (hold at 300 K for 1500 s)  
  - Maximum Temperature: 1000 K
  - Final Isotherm: None
* Sample mass: 5 mg +/- 0.1 mg
* Sample geometry: Powdered
* Calibration type: Before each experiment, a baseline test was performed using an empty crucible. Temperature/Heat flow calibration were performed every 12 months (or 100 tests, whichever is sooner) using a set of 6 reference materials with melting temperatures between 60-820 C
* Crucible
  - Type: Al2O3
  - Volume: 25.1 uL
  - Diameter: 5.00 mm
  - Mass: 87.3 mg +/- 0.6 mg
  - Lid: False
  - Note: Al2O3 crucibles (outer diameter 5mm / volume 25.13 uL) without a lid.
* Carrier Gas
  - Type: Nitrogen
  - Flow rate: 50 ml/min
  - Note: High Purity Nitrogen (99.9% or more)
* Pressure
  - Measurement were conducted while varying the pressure inside the experimental apparatus.
  - The pressure conditions were set to 100 kPa and 40 Pa.
  - Each pressure condition is indicated in the file name (e.g., filename_100kPa_R1).
* Instrument
  - Type: Rigaku/TG-DTA8122
  - Furnace Type: Platinum
  - Notes: None
