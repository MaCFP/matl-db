### Experimental Conditions: TGA/DSC
A NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter was used to simultaneously conduct Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiments. DSC data serve as suplementary only and are not suitable for calibration.

* Heating Rate: 5, 10, and 20 K/min
* Temperature program
  - Initial Temperature: 303 K
  - Initial Isotherm: 300 s (hold at 303 K for 300 s)  
  - Maximum Temperature: 973 K
  - Final Isotherm: 300 s (hold at 973 K for 300 s)
* Sample mass: 5 mg +/- 0.20 mg
* Sample geometry: Powdered
* Calibration type: For each heating rate, a single baseline test was performed using an empty crucible. Temperature/Heat flow calibration for each heating rate were performed prior to MaCFP measurements using a set of 5 reference materials (In, Bi, Zn, Al, Ag) with melting temperatures between 429-1225 K. For more accurate DSC measurements, baseline (blank) measurements would have to be performed before each individual run and the heat flow rate (W/g) would need to be recalculated for the actual, not the initial sample mass.
* Crucible
  - Type: Al2O3
  - Volume: 85 uL
  - Diameter: 9 mm
  - Mass: 132-139 mg
  - Lid: False
  - Note: NETZSCH Al2O3 crucibles were used (part ID NGB800453). For more accurate DSC measurements, Concavus crucibles would be required. 
* Carrier Gas
  - Type: Nitrogen
  - Flow rate: 50 ml/min (50 mL/min purge, 20 mL/min protective - no contact with the sample)
  - Note: Ultra High Purity (UHP) Nitrogen
* Instrument
  - Type: NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter
  - Furnace Type: Steel
  - Notes: None

##### Test Summary
Three repeated pyrolysis tests were conducted to measure the mass loss and front surface temperature of pyrolysis tests in nitrogen environment at external heat flux of 25 and 65 kW/m2, respectively. The sample has a circular shape, with a diameter of 9.52 cm (3.75 in.) and thickness of 0.6 cm. The sample was insulated both on the side and bottom.
