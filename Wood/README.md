|Folder Name| Description|
|---|---|
|Calibration_Data| Experimental measurements (e.g., TGA, DSC, Cone Calorimeter) used for pyrolysis model calibration (i.e., material property determination)|
|Calibration_Results|Results of numerical simulations demonstrating the ability of proposed material property sets to accurately *reproduce* relevant model calibration data|
|Computational_Results|Model predictions of sample decomposition in response to idealized zero- and one-dimensional heating scenarios (used for model to model comparison)|
|Material_Properties|Pyrolysis models (i.e., material property sets) organized in a standard .json format|
|Validation_Data|Experimental Measurements (sample mass loss and back surface temperature rise during anaerobic gasification of 'MaCFP-Wood' under external thermal radiation) for Pyrolysis Model Validation |
|Validation_Results|Results of numerical simulations demonstrating the ability of proposed material property sets to *predict* measured material decomposition behavior (used for model validation)|
