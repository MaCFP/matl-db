#### Welcome to the MaCFP Condensed Phase Subgroup database!

The MaCFP Condensed Phase Working Group was organized to enable the fire safety science research community to make significant progress towards establishing a common framework for the selection of experiments and the methodologies used to analyze these experiments when developing pyrolysis models. Key objectives of this effort include:
- Cataloguing current approaches used to parameterize pyrolysis models;
- Developing standard data set formats for experimental data on pyrolysis;
- Developing requirements for data set quality and establishing a data review committee;
- Quantifying the inter-laboratory variability for comparable experimental datasets; and
- Assessing the impact of the variability of model parameters on fire growth predictions

#### In preparation for MaCFP-4, please read the following:

#### Virtual Discusion Forum
If you have questions regarding any of the activities or measurement data of the MaCFP Condensed Subgroup, please [start a discussion post](https://github.com/MaCFP/matl-db/discussions). The purpose of this forum is to facilitate data sharing and model development to improve computational predictions of thermal degradation and pyrolysis in fire.

If you find problems with the database or if you have suggestions for improvement, please submit an [Issue](https://github.com/MaCFP/matl-db/issues).
