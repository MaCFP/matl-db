#### How to Submit Experimental Data

Experimental and Modeling Results will be submitted, stored, and made publicly available on the [MaCFP GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MaCFP/matl-db/tree/master/Non-charring/PMMA). Experimental data may be shared by submitting pull requests to this repository or by sending data via email to [Dr. Morgan Bruns] (mailto:brunsmc@vmi.edu).

###### File Format 
Experimental and Model results should be organized in simple ASCII comma-delimited files (*.csv files) with clear header names.  Note: For all submitted measurement data, please ensure that results are obtained with a data acquisition rate between 0.2 and 10 Hz. Examples of how to format data submissions, which may be used as templates, are included [here] (https://github.com/MaCFP/matl-db/tree/master/Non-charring/PMMA).

###### File Naming
For simplicity, please collect your files in a single folder with your INSTITUTE name [INSTITUTE]. Please save measurement results with a name indicating your INSTITUTE and the experimental apparatus used, for example: INSITUTE\_TGA.csv or Institute\_ConeCalorimeter_25kW.csv.  Gram-scale experiments (e.g., Cone, FPA, gasification) should include this external heat flux information in the file name, as indicated above; mg-scale experiments (e.g., TGA, DSC, MCC) do not need to include heating rate in the filename as this information will be evident from reported data.



###### File Organization
Measurement data from repeated experiments should be saved and submitted as separate files, numbered sequentially (e.g.,INSITUTE\_TGA1.csv and INSITUTE\_TGA2.csv). 


###### File Description
Please also include a separate README file (.txt or .docx) that provides a description of the test conditions of all experiments conducted and submitted (see the Measurements section of [Guidelines for Participation_MaCFP2020.pdf](https://github.com/MaCFP/matl-db/), for details on what information should be included in this file).   

Note, some iteration on formatting may be required before the results can be merged into the MaCFP database.
