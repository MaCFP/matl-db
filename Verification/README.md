## Model Verification

This folder holds numerical results (i.e., model predictions of heat transfer or material decomposition) that can be used for verifification and code-to-code comparison of computational pyrolysis solvers.

Cases of interest (tentative list) include:
1. 'Pure verification' (canonical cases)
a.  1D heat transfer
b. Heat transfer (with generation source term)
c. Internal radiation absorption
d. Arhenius rate decomposition
2. ‘Code to code’ comparison (verification)
(everyone has the same matl. Property sets, we each simulate the same base cases [TGA, ideal gasification, conduction…])
