### Test Summary
Standard cone calorimeter and tests were carried out on 100 x 100 x 6 mm slabs of cast black PMMA. Standard cone calorimeter sample holders were used to expose a 95 x 95 mm face of the material to the heating element. A Schmidt-boelter heat flux gauge was used to calibrate the conical heater to within 1% of the desired heat flux. 

The sample was wrapped with 1 layer of aluminum foil to contain the melting of the PMMA slab over the course of the experiment. The foil was in contact with an aluminum block 10 mm thick with a hole milled for a 1 mm K-type thermocouple. The thermocouple was located 5 mm from the surface that was in contact with the foil. The remaining sample holder depth was filled with ceramic paper.

Before each trial the sample mass was recorded. The sample was observed to be entirely consumed in all of the experiments. The thermocouple wire leading from the sample holder was ran between the opening of the glass doors of the cone calorimeter so that the doors could remain closed. Some slack was provided in the cable to mitigate tension on the sample, however the mass readings may have been influenced by the presence of the thermocouple wire. The reported mass includes the mass of the sample holder, aluminum block, and backing insulation. 

Difference between total mass lost and reported initial sample mass is generally within 5-10%; the highest difference observed was approximately 10 g. The difference in recorded mass loss and initial sample mass may be a result of the thermocouple wire interfering with load cell measurements.



#### Experimental Conditions
* Extraction flow rate: 24L/s nominal
* Sample Surface Area: 0.009 m2 (nominal)
* Note: Samples were 10x10cm, but supported in holders that exposed a 95 x 95 mm face of the material to the heating element
* Sample holder dimensions:
    - Square pan complying with specifications of standard ISO 5660-1
    - Retainer frame: None
* Backing Insulation: 3mm thick Superwool brand cermaic paper on the back face of an aluminum block in contact with sample. Density ~200 kg/m3; thermal conductivity 0.05 W/m/K @ 200 C, 0.3 W/m/K @ 1000 C; specific heat capacity unknown, but estimated ~1100 J/kg/K based on similar material
* Thermocouple location: a 1-mm thermocouple was placed in the aluminum block 5 mm from the surface on the block in contact with the foil (back face of the tested sample)
* Sample chamber doors were closed
