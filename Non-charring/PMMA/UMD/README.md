### Experimental Conditions: Gasification Tests (CAPA II)
A custom-built [Controlled Atmosphere Pyrolysis Apparatus II (CAPA II)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379711217300541) was used to perform anaerobic (02 concentration < 1 vol. %) gasification experiments of PMMA slabs in response to well-characterized radiant heating. 

Reported errors represent two standard deviations of the mean of the respective quantity. The temperature data were collected at 7.5 Hz and presented here without any data processing. The mass data were collected at a frequency of 2 Hz. The mass loss rate (MLR) was computed using a 5 s time differential and normalized by the initial top surface area of the sample. The data were subsequently grouped into 5 s bins for which mean MLR and mean time values were computed. The data is synchronized from the time when the sample is exposed to specific external heat flux. [# of repeat tests?]

Samples were epoxied to copper foil to reduce swelling, morphing and flowing; as well as to provide a substrate with good thermal contact to measure back surface temperatures. The exposed (back) side of the copper foil was painted with high emissivity paint (alpha = 0.95) allowing for temperature measurements on the backside of the sample using an IR camera.
* Temperature Measurements:
    Temperature measurements were made at 12 points representing 4 radial locations (r = 0, 0.01, 163 0.02 and 0.03 m from the center). However, since the temperature distribution was found to be radially uniform, average temperatures are reported here. 

##### CAPA II Boundary Conditions
The boundary conditions were averaged over the test duration for both heat fluxes. External radiation was measured by a Schmidt-Boelter heat flux gauge with a cooling water temperature of 290 K. The convective heat losses from the front and back sample surfaces were quantified through detailed simulations and further validated against experimental measurements.

External Radiant Heat Flux = 25 kW/m2
