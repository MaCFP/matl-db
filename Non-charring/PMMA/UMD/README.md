### Experimental Conditions: TGA, DSC
A Netzsch F3 Jupiter was used to conduct Simultaneous Thermal Analysis (TGA + DSC) experiments. Reported measurement data indicates an average of [##?##] repeated tests; errors are calculated as two standard deviations of the mean. More information is available at G.J. Fiola, D.M. Chaudhari, S.I. Stoliarov, "Comparison of Pyrolysis properties of extruded and cast Poly (methyl methacrylate)," submitted to IAFSS 2020.

### Experimental Conditions: MCC
An FAA microscale combustion calorimeter was used to conduct MCC experiments.  At the end of each test, the residual solid yield was measured and found to be consistent with the TGA results. Reported measurement data indicates an average of four (4) repeated tests; errors are calculated as two standard deviations of the mean.More information is available at G.J. Fiola, D.M.

### Experimental Conditions: Gasification Tests (CAPA II)
A custom-built [Controlled Atmosphere Pyrolysis Apparatus II (CAPA II)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379711217300541) was used to perform anaerobic (02 concentration < 1 vol. %) gasification experiments of PMMA slabs in response to well-characterized radiant heating. 

Reported errors represent two standard deviations of the mean of the respective quantity. The temperature data were collected at 7.5 Hz and presented here without any data processing. The mass data were collected at a frequency of 2 Hz. The mass loss rate (MLR) was computed using a 5 s time differential and normalized by the initial top surface area of the sample. The data were subsequently grouped into 5 s bins for which mean MLR and mean time values were computed. The data is synchronized from the time when the sample is exposed to specific external heat flux. [# of repeat tests?]

* Extraction flow rate (exhaust): 175L/s
* Nitrogen flow rate: 185 SLPM.
* Sample holder dimensions:
    - Circular pan: diameter = 0.08 m
    - Insulation thickness around the sample 0.01m

  - Diameter: 0.07 m
  - Thickness: 0.0058 m
* Backing Insulation: None  
Samples were epoxied to copper foil to reduce swelling, morphing and flowing; as well as to provide a substrate with good thermal contact to measure back surface temperatures. The exposed (back) side of the copper foil was painted with high emissivity paint (alpha = 0.95) allowing for temperature measurements on the backside of the sample using an IR camera.
* Temperature Measurements:
    Temperature measurements were made at 12 points representing 4 radial locations (r = 0, 0.01, 163 0.02 and 0.03 m from the center). However, since the temperature distribution was found to be radially uniform, average temperatures are reported here. 

##### CAPA II Boundary Conditions
The boundary conditions were averaged over the test duration for both heat fluxes. External radiation was measured by a Schmidt-Boelter heat flux gauge with a cooling water temperature of 290 K. The convective heat losses from the front and back sample surfaces were quantified through detailed simulations and further validated against experimental measurements. 

###### External Heat Flux = 25 kW/m2
_**Front surface**_  
External Radiant Heat Flux = 25 kW/m2  
Average convection coefficient = 8.6 W/(m^2  K)  
Average outside gas temperature = 330 K  
_**Back surface**_  
Average convection coefficient = 4 W/(m^2 K)  
Average outside gas temperature = 300 K  

###### External Heat Flux = 60 kW/m2  
_**Front surface**_  
External Radiant Heat Flux = 60 kW/m2

### Absorption Coefficient  
The density normalized absorption coefficient was found to be 2.38 m^2/kg with an error (two times the standard error of the mean) of 0.23 m^2/kg.
